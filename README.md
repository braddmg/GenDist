# GenDist
GenDist is a pipeline design to measure the co-occurrence and genetic distance of gene pairs in a set of m√∫ltiple plasmids, genomes or contigs.

# Installing conda environment 
Copy and activate the conda environment 

```
git clone https://github.com/braddmg/GenDist
cd GenDist
conda env create -f GenDist.yml
conda activate GenDist
```
# Generteting a co-occurrence matrix 
To create a co-occurrence analysis we need a presence absence matrix with contigs as columns and genes as rows. See the file matrix.csv as example.
Then we can run the R script with the matrix.

```
git clone https://github.com/braddmg/GenDist
cd GenDist
conda env create -f GenDist.yml
conda activate GenDist
```
